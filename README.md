# Automated Pet Feeder System

## Project Summary

This project presents a simulated logic design for an **Automated Pet Feeder System** developed as part of the *Introduction to Information Technology (4478/8936)* unit at the **University of Canberra**. The system is intended to support a local animal shelter by automating pet feeding tasks using low-cost components and smart scheduling.

The feeder:
- Dispenses food for cats and dogs at scheduled times.
- Monitors food consumption using sensors.
- Alerts staff if food is not dispensed or not eaten.

The solution follows a structured problem-solving methodology and is designed to be implemented on platforms like Arduino or Raspberry Pi in future iterations.

##  Problem-Solving Process

### Step 1: Define the Problem
- Identified system requirements and constraints.
- Outlined inputs (e.g., feeding time, sensors) and outputs (e.g., motor, alerts).
- Created a system sketch to visualize component interactions.

### Step 2: Organize the Data
- Listed all input/output types and operational parameters.
- Created a data table with sample values and expected behavior.

### Step 3: Design the Algorithm
- Developed a flowchart using Draw.io to represent system logic.
- Included decision-making for feeding, error detection, and alerts.

### Step 4: Implement the Solution
- Translated logic into plain English code using modular tasks.
- Used meaningful variable names and clear comments.

### Step 5: Test and Refine
- Tested scenarios: pet eats, pet doesnâ€™t eat, food bin empty, sensor failure.
- Suggested refinements: retry logic, remote alerts, feeding logs.

## AI Agent Integration

Microsoft Copilot was used to:
- Refine logic and word-based code.
- Explore real-world implementation using Arduino.
- Improve documentation and README formatting.
- Reflect on ethical implications of AI in pet care.
